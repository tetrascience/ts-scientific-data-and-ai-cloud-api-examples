TetraScience Scientific Data Cloud API Usage Examples

## Getting started

* Install Python 3.7.x (We recommend using pyenv if you have to work with multiple versions on the same machine.)
* Install [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/) for dependency management and packaging in Python.
* Install [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/install)

## Overview

Our [Public API](https://developers.tetrascience.com/reference/introduction-1) provides methods to get information about data acquisition (Agents), get information about files stored in the data lake, search through and modify files in the data lake, and programmatically create and execute data pipelines.

While these APIs provide access to the platform, there exist some common use patterns across customers documented in this repo. Additional use cases can be created by leveraging the APIs in systematic fashions and this repo is designed to get you started using the APIs and give you a sense of what you can accomplish.

## Contribute
